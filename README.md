# Employee-Churn
Machine Learning Experiment for predicting employee's Churn

Project Link : https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Employee-Leaving-prediction

Problem Statement :  Using two-class Logistic Regression prediction of the Employee's churn is done.

Project Description :
   
 First of all we need to get data to process. We can upload our data in csv.format and use it as well. The data entries such as Employee-ID, Satisfaction-level, Last evaluation, Project numbers,average of monthly hours, time spent in company or organiation, promotion, salary and department, etc..Preprocessing of raw data is done before tarining the model.As we've created our owwn data,there is no eed of data cleaning. To get the clear data, a module is added called edit metadata for that process. Individual measurable properties are called features.The left column will contain our respective output.The model s trained accordingly to the given input.Now the data is ready constitute of a predictive model composed of training and testing. We can use our data to train the model, and then we'll test the built model to observe that how much accurately it shall able to predict the churn and data of employee.

I've implemented this experiment using Azure Machine Learning Studio (Classic).
